## Takeaway From IS445

I think my biggest takeaway from class was how to effectively analyze graphs more. I really enjoyed the weekly visualization assignemnets because it wasn't often I got the chance to do that recently. I haven't taken a technical course in a while so it was a ice breath of fresh air. Even though it seems really minisule being able to look at a graph and find flaws such as it's unclear/missing labels, misleading scaling and chaoic formatting will help me a lot in my future full time career since I am a bit of a slide maker at work. Furthermore being on the other side and analyzing the graphs from the information it is giving down to the colors or size of the bars have kind of given me a hidden side of appreciation for the work. Overall, my biggest takeaway from class was to not underestimate and effective and well crafted graph. 

## What Could Be Improved About IS445

Honestly, as a second semester senior I don't have much idea on what could be improved for the class. If I was to say one thing I would have preferred more group assignments in class. I think it being an online class makes it hard to connect to other students because you aren't really put in the situation to connect and discuss about topics and I know you did your best with all the circumstances that happened some weeks that resulted in the cancellation of classes so I don't think this truly is much of an issue. Overall I thought everything was ran very finely and wish you all the best!
